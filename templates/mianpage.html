    What Is Apple TV+? Everything You Need To Know

    Not only will you gain access to popular movies and TV shows, but also Apple TV originals from Apple TV+. That service has a subscription fee, which you can buy individually or through Apple One—a package service you should consider if you’re already using other Apple services such as Apple Music and Apple Fitness+.
    
     <h1>Viewing Quality </h1>
    While some of the listed rental services offer different price points depending on the video quality you desire, Apple only offers one high-quality price point. Its rentals will automatically play in the highest resolution available, whether that is 4K, 1080p, or 480p.
    
    As is usual for Apple, the experience is part of the cost. Although it may not be the cheapest rental service around, Apple strives to be the best. The streaming platform is easy to use, has a clean design, and is a great option if you’re already comfortable with Apple products and services.
    
   <h1> Viewing Options</h1>
    Apple TV services are best enjoyed on an Apple device. If you’re using an iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, Apple TV, or any Mac, you should already have the Apple TV app downloaded. If you can’t find it, just search Apple TV in the App Store. From there, open up the app and enjoy.
    
    If you have a smart TV, there’s also a good chance you can find the Apple TV app without needing to purchase the Apple TV device. Worst-case scenario, you can also sign up and stream through the Apple TV website on any Windows or Google device.
    
    You may also be able to purchase access to Apple TV directly through your cable provider, depending on who you use. This is a great option if you’re considering purchasing the monthly subscription services. Give the free trial a shot the next time you need to rent a movie.
